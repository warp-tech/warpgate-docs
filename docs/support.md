# Support

Warpgate offers a professional support service that includes:

* **2 hours of e-mail support** per month (SLA, 24 hours response time)
* A meet-and-greet Zoom call with your ops team.
* Prioritized GitHub issue handling.
* Access to **custom feature development** (billed separately on per-project basis).
* Knowing that the software your company relies on for core security has a stable future, while being maintained and continuously improved.

!!! NOTE "Pricing"
    The professional support service costs **$750** per month.

In the times where one project after another falls into the enshittification cycle of becoming a worse SaaS version of itself, this funding model allows Warpgate to stay what it was always meant to be: a secure, open and robust gatekeeper at the edge of your infrastructure.
